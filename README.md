# openjdk-proposals
A place for Microsoft's Java Engineering Group to put [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) 
JDK Enhancement Proposals and/or patches if we don't have an author space at OpenJDK itself.

Files will be held here on a temporary basis.

The LICENSE matches that of the OpenJDK project.
